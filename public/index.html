    <p>Quick and Dirty PHP website hosting (with PHP support) using Aws Lambda (i.e. pay by requests instead of paying a fixed monthly hosting fees). </p>

    <p>Remember the good old days when you used to FTP your PHP files, static HTML files, css files to a web server? Now you can do that using
        AWS Lambda with LambdaPHP!</p>

    <h2 id="butwhyshouldicare">But why should I care?</h2>

    <p>Any files you put inside the <code>public</code> directory will be accessible as if they were hosted on an Apache server with
        <code>mod_php</code>. There are no handlers to write or config files to maintain. For example if you have two files, <em>index.php</em>
        and <em>deep/other.php</em> inside your <code>public</code> folder, by just typing <code>lambdaphp deploy</code> you can deploy them online at https://yourdomain.com/index.php, https://yourdomain.com/deep/other.php, etc. </p>

    <p><strong>Difference is you don't have to pay any monthly hosting fees</strong> because they're running on AWS Lambda which
        means you are billed only by the number of requests. This includes 1 million free requests per month and 400,000 GB-seconds
        of compute time per month (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/">details here</a>).</p>

    <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

    <p>Installation is simple. All you need is PHP 7+ with <a href="https://getcomposer.org"><code>composer</code></a></p>

    <p>To install, just type this on your command line (terminal)</p>

    <pre><code>composer create-project lambdaphp/lambdaphp &lt;project-name&gt;
</code></pre>

    <p>This should create a <em>project-name</em> directory inside which there is a <code>public</code> directory. Any files,
        including any PHP files you put in the <code>public</code> directory can be accessed directly from your web browser.</p>

    <p>Once your are done putting files in the <code>public</code> folder, just type this on your command line to
        deploy your site on AWS Lambda:</p>

    <pre><code>lambdaphp deploy -v
</code></pre>

    <p><em>You may need to enter your AWS credentials as <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html">described here</a> (same as aws-cli)</em>. </p>

    <p>If everything goes as expected, you should see this message:</p>

    <pre><code>Website deployed!
To access your site visit:
https://XXXX.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/web/&lt;any-file-in-public-folder&gt;&lt;.php|css|js|etc&gt;
</code></pre>

    <p><em>(If you get a "command not found" error, make sure you have <code>./vendor/bin</code> in your PATH)</em></p>

    <p>That's it! LambdaPHP will give you the URL using which you can access your site just like any other
        site hosted on Apache. It is possible to use your <strong>own custom domains</strong> with https too (<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/how-to-custom-domains.html">details here</a>).</p>

    <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><p>Which PHP version will my site be running?</p>

            <p>Currently it supports PHP 7.2.</p></li>

        <li><p>Is it really free to host my site this way?</p>

            <p>Yes you get 1 million free requests per month and and 400,000 GB-seconds of compute time per month.
                Currently lambdaphp runs very fast with 128MB RAM and has an average response time is 400ms. So using the <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/lambda-tools/pricing-calculator.html">pricing calculator here</a>,
                you can process about 1,000,000 (1M) requests per month free of cost. YMMV. Also remember every assets on your page creates a new request, so factor that in and bundle them together using Webpack.</p></li>

        <li><p>How do I update my site?</p>

            <p>Just run <code>lambdaphp deploy</code> again!</p></li>

        <li><p>My site is loading slowly?</p>

            <p>The average load time is 500ms (via pingdom).
                <a href="https://www.phase2technology.com/blog/bundle-your-front-end-with-webpack">Use Webpack</a> to reduce the number of requests per page (bundle CSS, JS, Font files, etc into a single js file). This will also make sure to reduce the number of requests per load helping you stretch your 1M requests even more.  </p></li>

        <li><p>How much traffic can this handle?</p>

            <p>Theoretically speaking AWS Lambda scales very well so it should be able to handle a lot of traffic easily. It performs better with more traffic since that reduces the load time. But for anything above 20M requests / mo, you'll be missing the point of this whole thing because you can get a dedicated instance for $10/mo anyway ;)       </p></li>

        <li><p>How do I add <code>X</code> PHP extension?</p>

            <p>I've currently compiled php using the most popular PHP extensions. If you need to a custom extension, just using the
                Dockerfile in Robert's project below. </p></li>

        <li><p>What's the point of it anyway?</p>

            <p>It's a quick and dirty way to get simple PHP website online without paying any monthly hosting fees. Also a great resource if you wish to
                learn Amazon's amazing services like API Gateway, AWS Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, Cognito (which work together under the hood of lambdaphp) for your own sites.</p></li>
